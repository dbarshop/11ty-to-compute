# Meet the Saddies

Here is where I'll put info about me and Moy.

        <h2>Alanna Gonzalez</h2>
        <p class="title">Co-Founder</p>
        <p>I’m Alanna, the friend who double checks your email before you click send. I’ve spent most of my career in HR adjacent roles and all of my career wondering where people get the audacity. As much as I’ve tried to avoid being a careerist, I’ve gathered many tips and tricks along the way. I’m constantly redefining what success looks like for me and the biggest advocate for using up all your PTO. A reluctant corporate baddie, who is sometimes, often a corporate saddie too. </p>

        <h2>Deanna Barshop</h2>
        <p class="title">Co-Founder</p>
        <p>Hello, Deanna here! While in college, I accidentally fell into the tech industry. Now a decade up the corporate ladder, I’m reflecting on the journey and excited to share my thoughts with you.</p>
        <p>I believe strongly in making careers in tech more accessible for women of color. I also know first hand the isolation and self-doubt that can come with being in this industry. I hope to help you spend less time being a saddie and get on the fast track to being a professional baddie.</p>
