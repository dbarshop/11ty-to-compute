        <p>I’m Alanna, the friend who double checks your email before you click send. I’ve spent most of my career in HR-adjacent roles and all of my career wondering where people get the audacity.</p>
        <p>As much as I’ve tried to avoid being a careerist, I’ve gathered many tips and tricks along the way. I’m constantly redefining what success looks like for me,  and I'm the biggest advocate for using up all your PTO. A reluctant professional baddie, who is sometimes, often, a professional saddie too. </p>

        <p class="title">Co-Founder</p>
        <p>Hello, Deanna here! While in college, I accidentally fell into the tech industry. Now a decade up the corporate ladder, I’m reflecting on the journey and excited to share my thoughts with you.</p>
        <p>I believe strongly in making careers in tech more accessible for women of color. I also know first hand the isolation and self-doubt that can come with being in this industry. I hope to help you spend less time being a saddie and get on the fast track to being a professional baddie.</p>
