Being human means riding the highs and lows of life and that includes the highs and lows of work. When we get a new job, it can be so exciting to finally get paid for our worth or to be chasing after our dreams. That’s not to say everyday will be exciting though. You can have the title, pay, coworkers that you’ve always wanted, but still have bad days at work. The project you were so excited about reaches a set back, you mixed up clients at work, you choked on a presentation, or you flat out just made a mistake. Whatever the reason for the bad day, they exist and that’s okay! Just remember:

## It’s Just Work and People Make Mistakes at Work 

I’d bet nowhere in your contract does it say you can never make a mistake, so why does work feel like a place where we can’t make mistakes? It’s possible you are holding yourself to a higher standard that no one is expecting. While it would be nice to be absolutely perfect 100% of the time at work, we’re human, not robots. That means there is probably an expected measure of human error for any given task. 

## Slow Down and Take a Moment 

It can be easy to want to rush and fix your mistake as quickly as possible, but sometimes in the heat of the moment it can lead to more mistakes. You may also feel like you just want to move on and forget about whatever happened. It’s okay to slow down and take a moment to process what went wrong or how you feel about a situation. Very rarely do things need to be solved that very second, so assess the situation, feel all you want to feel, and then gameplan your next move. 

## Take Accountability and Move On 

Despite all your best intentions, you might be the one who makes the mistake at work and we know now that’s okay! We all know those coworkers (or bosses even!) that blame other people, technology, or mercury retrograde for their mistakes instead of admitting it was them. When you do make a mistake, and it will happen, try your best to own up to it as quickly as possible. As discussed, people make mistakes and it’s OK. When it inevitably happens, try saying something like this:

*“Thank you for flagging that report to me. I recognize now my numbers were off due to my miscalculation. I will be sure to be more conscientious moving forward!”*

*“Ah thank you for bringing that up, that’s 1000% on me. I’ll go ahead and fix that now!”*

*“I simply was moving too fast and mixed up my responses. Appreciate your patience, let me get a fresh version out in the next hour!”*

*“I also don’t think that was my best work and want to do better. Next time, I’d like to try doing xyz ahead of the presentation.”*

## You’re Still a Good Person

Our work does not define who we are morally. Making a mistake or having a bad day does not mean that we are bad people. Plus, good people make mistakes too.
