Boundaries at work are essential for longevity in the workplace, but they are often something easily compromised. We all know that one coworker or boss who works late nights and into the weekend, never taking a vacation. You might find these colleagues are praised for their “dedication” and being an exceptional team player. 
The harsh reality is no one is going to set or keep your boundaries at work except for you. If someone is consistently willing to work non-stop outside of the 9 to 5, of course they’re getting more work done than you. Why would a boss or management step in to stop that? The truth is, work never stops. When one project ends, there’s always another one waiting. Work will always be there, but you don’t have to make it your whole personality. Here are some helpful tips for setting work boundaries at your new job. 

## Calendar Management

Calendar management can be a powerful tool to set boundaries at work. If you work in a distributed company, people are often working across many time zones. It can be difficult to schedule meetings if people are unaware what time you work. See if your work calendar has the option to set ‘working hours.’ This helps your colleagues see what time you log on and off for the day. Then, if you’re offline and someone is trying to reach you, they’ll be able to see when you’re online next. 

You can also try carving out calendar blocks for ‘focus time’ where you can be heads down for uninterrupted work. During this time, challenge yourself to quiet your notifications and only focus on the tasks that need to be done. Whether this block is 30 minutes or a few hours, people will know it’s your dedicated working time. 
Block out time for your lunch break! Many employees are required by law to take at least a 30 minute break for lunch. Unless you’re required to clock in and out, this lunch time might not be strictly enforced. So, it may be on you to take or not take your lunch. Even if you don’t plan to eat during that time, try to block at least 30 minutes each day to rest, go on a walk, stretch, or chat with a friend. 

Often, calendars will quickly fill up with team meetings, company all hands, one-on-ones with your boss, and other items! Be diligent about checking your calendar when a new invite rolls in. What’s free on someone else’s calendar may not necessarily work for your schedule so be sure to take a look and prioritize accordingly. 
A good habit is to look at your calendar first thing in the morning or first thing during the week so you can plan properly for what’s ahead. Being able to see a visual representation of your workload will set you up for success for the week. 

## Talking With Your Boss

Sometimes creating and holding boundaries with your boss can be extremely difficult. You may think, “they’re the boss, don’t I have to do what they say when they say?” Having healthy boundaries at work is essential for you to get your work done. Having clear expectations with your higher ups helps avoid miscommunication, burnout, and frustration – a win win for everyone!

When you start a job, get aligned with your boss on what hours you are expected to sign in and out for the day. Is there a certain time you need to take lunch or can you take it whenever you want? Do you get paid for hours worked overtime? 

Make sure you have a clear understanding of your job and responsibilities. Often projects may pop up and random things are thrown your way, so when that happens, be sure to clarify the urgency and timeline before saying yes. If you are juggling many items and your boss is trying to add one more, clarify what sacrifices might need to be made in order to meet their deadline. Some phrases you can try out:

*Do you have a timeline for when you’d like this completed by? I want to make sure I fully understand your request so that I can prioritize accordingly. I am currently working on xyz which is due in two weeks, so does it make sense to you to deprioritize xyz so I can pick up this new project?*

*I definitely recognize this work is important to get done as we’re butting up against our deadline this week. I can stay an extra 30 minutes this evening, but then I’ll have to pick up the rest in the morning.*

*I know we have just a few minutes left in this meeting and I have a hard stop today. I’m happy to take down my action items and work on them in the morning. Let’s also set up some more time to discuss this item since we’re running low on time!*

## Holding Yourself Accountable 

Setting boundaries at work is important, but the boundaries are useless unless you hold yourself to them! Work can be chaotic and it’s easy for your time to be eaten up with requests, projects, and meetings. Companies will always take as much as you’re willing to give. The times when it’s most busy is when it’s most important to hold firm to your boundaries. It’s also important to remain flexbile. For example, while it’s needed for you to take a lunch break every day, if your lunch time is the ONLY time another person can meet with you, consider moving your lunch break earlier or later to accommodate. That’s not to say it should happen every time someone asks, but know where your limits are. It’s easier to loosen your boundaries than it is to build them back up. 

Sometimes with boundaries in the workplace, you have to be strategic about them. If you always respond to emails within seconds, people will start to believe that’s the expectation when they are communicating with you. This is not a sustainable habit! Also, unless it’s truly an emergency, not every email needs an immediate response. That being said, sometimes it is easier to respond in the moment and get your idea/response out of your brain and onto an email. Most emails have a ‘send later’ feature so you can write a response and choose when to schedule the send. Even if it’s just 5-10 minutes later, that can put your time back into your hands and so you don’t feel obligated to respond on someone else’s timeline. 

Do your best to resist working outside of your set working hours. If you are not an on-call employee, there is no reason for you to make yourself one. If you have your work inbox and Slack connected to your personal phone, it can be really easy to slip into the mindset of ‘oh I’ll respond to this really quick.’ Keeping a dedicated workspace and devices separate can help you keep your boundaries firm. If you absolutely must have your work items on your personal device, challenge yourself to leave the notifications on those apps off and dedicate certain times of the day to check. No need for you to be on alert 24/7. Those emails will be there in the morning, promise :) 

Setting boundaries can be difficult in any setting, but especially in the workplaces! As you work to grow your career, the need to build healthy boundaries that work for you will be key to your success. Your boundaries will show others how you work best and what can be realistically expected from you. Be sure to save this article and put these items in play next time someone toes your boundary line.
